## Hi, Dania here! ðŸ‘¾

My journey into the field of data feels a lot like going for a hikeâ€”
$\color{magenta}{\textsf{there are many summits to conquer.}}$
When you reach one peak, you might think you've made it to the top, only to discover there's another summit waiting for you just ahead.

I started my career as an automation engineer, but my passion for IT led me to explore a beginner role in system administration. As I delved deeper, I found myself drawn to data science and machine learning. This realization sparked my desire to climb higher in my career, as I recognized that I had finally discovered my true summitâ€”
$\color{magenta}{\textsf{the data field.}}$

Along this path, I uncovered my talent for $\color{magenta}{\textsf{navigating the complexities of data analysis, mining, statistics, dashboards, ETL processes, and data pipelines.}}$
<br> Each step of the way has fueled my enthusiasm to explore even more.

As a seasoned data professional, my primary focus is on data analysis, enabling me to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets that inform decision-making and drive business outcomes. 
I also specialize in $\color{magenta}{\textsf{designing, managing ETL pipelines, and making dashboards in Excel and Power BI}}$, particularly within the oil and gas sector. My career journey has been fueled by a commitment to establishing robust, secure, and efficient computing environments that support data processing and analytics in these industries. Proficient in Python, I excel in scripting for automation and monitoring system performance.

While I have honed my abilities in both Data Analysis and Data Engineering, my primary challenge lies in deepening my understanding of modern technologies in both areas, which are crucial for advancing in today's data-driven ecosystem.

Driven by a commitment to continuous learning, I embrace new challenges with enthusiasm. Whether optimizing data models, delving into advanced SQL techniques, or exploring emerging technologies like serverless architecture, I am dedicated to pushing boundaries and delivering impactful results.


*  Currently seeking a job as a $\color{magenta}{\textsf{Data Analyst.}}$ or $\color{magenta}{\textsf{Data Engineer.}}$
*  Apart from tech-coding, I am also range from anime-lover, an avid manga/manhwa/book reader, illustrator, to chocolate-lover. This is what my fully fuel. Let me know if we're gangs ðŸ‘¾ Nice to meet you all.
